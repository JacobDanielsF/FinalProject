This repository contains a file called gen-inherit.zip. This is the zip
of the entire game and all of its assets. The game's scripts also exist
within the base level of the repository.

One of our group members had trouble running the game on their computer
in the past, so if any of the graders runs into severe lag issues then
please contact our team. This may be a specific issue with running the
game on Chrome but we're not exactly sure why it occurs.
